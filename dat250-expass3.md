## Technical problems
For once the installiation part went smoothly. The only thing i had some problems with was the query/read part of the tutorial defaulted to the Compass "language". I tried to insert the collection we were given into the database with Compass however that didnt accept the syntax of the collection. They also supported inserting data with a json file, and the collection was almost in json format but did not have quotation marks around the key names. Luckily, i found an online tool that fixed that problem automatically. The queries in Compass worked fine. 

## Map reduce discussion

The map reduce functions looks at all the items in every order and finds out how many orders each item is in (count), the total quantity (qty) and the average quantity per order (avg). From a business owner point of view, this information is very useful. Looking at the quantity reveals which items are selling best (and which are not). The order can be used with quanitity to see if items are popular for many (high order and high quanity) or if they are bought in masses (low order and high quantity) which is what the average is also telling. This information can be used to guide future sales and how they should stock up on each item.

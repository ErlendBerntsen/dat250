I already had all the software needed installed on my pc from before, so I didn't really have any problems on that part. 
However, I can remember when installing maven that I had trouble executing maven commands in the terminal since I forgot to setup a PATH variable. 
Since I regularly use the software and know that it works I didn't feel the need to validate it any more than that. 
The tutorial for Heroku also requires that the software works so completing that kind of works as an validation. 
I have also used Heroku for an hobby project this summer so I've already done the getting-started tutorial, however, I deleted that and did it again. 
I didn't have any problems with the tutorial this time, but I remember vividly having trouble with my hobby project with deploying a spring-boot application combined with a 
react application on the same heroku server. Heroku does have great support for deplying those type of applications separately, 
but combining them with a single dyno was troublesome. I solved it by googling and found some blogpost doing the same 
(spring-boot & java for backend, react & javascript for frontend), but there were differences in choices of other technologies so it didn't become just a copy-paste solution.

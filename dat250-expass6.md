## Technical Problems

I've already done lots of Spring tutorials now and I've also done the React tutorial before so I had the required frameworks and technologies already installed and available so i avoided any headache with that. It's been a long time since I've touched React so it was good to get a refresher on that. All in all, the experiments went smoothly this time.

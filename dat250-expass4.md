## Technical Problems
I cloned the code for the first experiment into IntelliJ, but it contained some Eclipse specific files and I immediately gave up on getting it to work in IntelliJ and imported the code to Eclipse instead (there were a lot of errors when i imported it into IntelliJ). I'm quite rusty with Eclipse but managed to get the first experiment to work after some small fixing. However, in experiment 2 when we needed to use the Todo-class from the tutorial i ran into many problems. I needed to create the persistence file again which i put into a META-INF folder in the src folder. I also added all the required JARs to the classpath. When i ran the program, i just got an error saying "No Persistence provider for EntityManager named todos" which was very annoying. Googling this problem was no help at all (they all had solutions which i've already done such as making sure the file is in the META-INF folder etc.). After that i just cloned the todo project again into IntelliJ which worked fine. Now i just needed to add the code for doing CRUD operations through HTTP requests which went smoothly.

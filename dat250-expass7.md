## Technical Problems
I installed RabbitMQ with Chocolatey which didn't give me any problems. However, the tutorials wants you to compile and run the programs through the terminal. This gave me lots of trouble trying to make it work. When i tried to compile (in the terminal) it said that it couldn't find the names of the java files. I was in the root directory of the project so i changed down to the folder that only contains the java classes. At least now it found the classes, but couldn't compile because it didn't understand the RabbitMQ datastructures in the code, even though i provided the RabbitMQ jar file as an argument. I figured this had something to do with IntelliJ not really adding the JARs to the classpath even if they are added as depedencies in the project. It worked by providing the absolute path to the jar file in my download folder in the compile argument. I ran into problems again when i tried to run the programs, so i tried to do the whole thing in Eclise instead (i tried really hard to make it work in IntelliJ before giving up). One big problem was that i couldn't find the terminal in Eclipse because apperantly the terminal didn't come packaged with my installation of Eclipse. After spending some time trying to figure out how you add new software to Eclipse, i managed to download the marketplace and add the TM terminal tool. Opening a new terminal window just gave me a white screen which i couldn't type in so now i just gave up on making it work in Eclipse. After thinking about it i concluded that running the program from the terminal isn't really essential to the tutorial. Instead i edited the run configurations in IntelliJ (allowing multiple instances, specifying program arguments etc.) which was a decent solution.
